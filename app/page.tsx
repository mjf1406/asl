                        I first thought of using sign language during silent
                        time when I learned about the{" "}

                        (big updates coming soon!) because I realized that
                        sometimes I needed to say many more words than just one
                        to my students while staying silent. Neither I nor my
                        students were fluent ASL speakers, so...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I decided to try it out at Maple Bear back in 2021, but
                        it didnâ€™t land as well as I had hoped, partly because I
                        didnâ€™t stick with it for whatever reason. However, at
                        Younghoon, I put up the posters without mentioning them
                        at all. One giant poster was next to the SMART Board,
                        and another smaller poster was just under the analog
                        clock.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I could have never foreseen what my students would do
                        during the first silent time after I put up those
                        posters. You see, those posters had a title, &quot;Sign
                        Language,&quot; and a subtitle, &quot;For use during
                        Silent Time.&quot; Well, guess what they started doing?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They started signing to me! And the funniest part was
                        that I didnâ€™t even know what they were doing! &quot;Why
                        are you moving your hands like that? Are you okay?&quot;
                        In the end, we learned together, and many of them LOVED
                        it. They even asked me to create a Blooket for them to
                        play. Let&apos;s be real â€” they just wanted an excuse to
                        play more Blooket in class, but you know what?
                        That&apos;s okay! ðŸ˜‚
